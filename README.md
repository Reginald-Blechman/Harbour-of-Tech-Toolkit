# Harbour-of-Tech-Toolkit

SOOOOOO... Harbour of tech himself asked me to find the exact thing that his toolkit does to check whether the OS is tiny11 or not. So here it is LOL!

Place the DLL file into :
```%PROGRAMFILES%\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\v3.5\```

Download harbout of tech toolkit from here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A9DwWvIwVrPq2xAOPXxJ5G7ADEHL-ijQ/view

That's all Enjoy!
